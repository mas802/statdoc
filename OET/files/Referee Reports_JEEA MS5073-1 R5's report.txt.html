JEEA-5073 Expectation formation in an evolving game of uncertainty

Forster et al.



This paper elicits experimental participants’ beliefs in a dynamic computer game. It fits various parametric probability weighting functions to the stated beliefs, and tests whether beliefs relate to behavior. 



Evaluation: Although I strongly agree that eliciting beliefs, testing their relation to behavior, and identifying their structure are useful exercises in many situations, I could not really identify the research question in the current paper. The paper has no substantive contribution: the beliefs in the car game do not inform us about any relevant economic question, be it bidding in auctions, or behavior in bargaining or coordination games, where uncertainty is high and subjective beliefs matter. I also do not see any significant methodological contribution. The paper confirms that subjective beliefs are somewhat (but not perfectly) related to behavior, and that elicited beliefs follow an inverse-S shape, sometimes called conservatism (eg Huck-Weizaecker 2002, JEBO). Both findings are important, but they are well known in two fields. 



First, in the literature on probability elicitation many papers have found conservatism; they also showed that subjective beliefs are informative (eg Hurd, 2009, Annual Reviews). Second, in the literature on uncertainty and ambiguity, people working with prospect theory have studied weighting functions intensively. The book by Wakker (2010 “Prospect theory”), as well as many papers by Mohammed Abdellaoui and coauthors, and Martin Weber and coauthors, have been concerned with such measurements. For example, the paper by Abdellaoui et al. (2011 AER) plots such weighting functions in their figure 1, in particular the well-known inverse-S shape under uncertainty. All papers in the fields of ambiguity-uncertainty and belief elicitation naturally deal with uncertainty where probabilities are unknown, rather than known probabilities as the authors claim all other studies have supposedly focused on.   

 

Thus, though interesting in substantive applications, I do not see the goal of the current paper. If the paper is meant as a replication of the inverse-S weighting, it should probably aim at a specialized field journal, and be much more concise and focused on open questions. An interesting point in the paper concerns the evolution of beliefs. The current paper finds that the weighting curve gets steeper over time, with more information. Baillon et al. (2013, working paper Erasmus University, “Learning under ambiguity”) study this question and also find the effect, which they call “reduced likelihood insensitivity.” Thus, this might provide a useful starting point for the current paper, because these effects are yet less studied and a replication can deliver useful insights.

    

Some remarks:



1) S-shape vs. inverse-S shape: The authors repeatedly mix up inverse-S-shaped and S-shaped weighting functions, for example in the abstract, but also in the main text. An S-shaped function underweights small probabilities (or rather, events) and overweights large ones. I find this inaccuracy a bit disturbing: non-experts who just skim the paper to get the main result may get a wrong impression here.     



2) Decision weights vs. probability perception: I know that many papers do not treat the difference with care. Still, there is a difference between weighting functions in the sense that prospect theory typically assumes for decision weights, as studied in the Wu-Gonzales papers for example (which the current paper cites), and weighting functions that describe probability perception (biased probabilities). Indeed, the former literature, when studying the case of decisions with known probabilities, trivially assumes unbiased probabilities (because known). However, the decision maker reveals probabilistic risk attitudes through decision weights. This is similar to a decision maker who understands that 20K is twice 10K, but because of utility curvature finds a move from zero to 10K more attractive than from 10K to 20K. In contrast, for belief measurements, for example in the health field where some medical conditions have very low probabilities, people simply hold wrong beliefs, overweighting the probability of unlikely events (see e.g. Kooremans-Carman, working paper, Rand “Flu shots”). The current paper seems to be written with this latter view in mind. The distinction should be made much more carefully.

 

3) Experiment: I could not really find out unambiguously whether each participant in each “race” was pitted against other participants, or against computerized competitors. That makes a difference of course. That makes a difference, because otherwise we would not expect the trivial negative relationship between investment in motor quality and motor failure. Even with computerized competitors it is not so clear what the behavior of the other ‘players’ is supposed to be.



4) page 8: discussion of Julien and Salanie etc., and elsewhere: It seems the authors do not really consider the possible details of utility functions and reference dependence. They argue that prospect theory outperformed rank-dependent, which was better that expected utility, but could not reject linear weighting function. That seems a bit weird; rank-dependent utility with linear weighting function is equal to expected utility. Maybe I misunderstand the authors argument here.
