\title{Expectation Formation and Risk-Taking under Uncertainty: Evidence from Car Race
Experiments}
\author{Schaffner/Foster/Frijters/Torgler}
\maketitle

\section{Introduction}

How do people form expectations about the outcome of an uncertain
process, and how does this relate to their actual choice?
Experimental results have established that people do not exhibit
risk neutrality when making choices about uncertain outcomes. What
is not known is whether people's actual expectations are correct or
whether their individual proclivities (risk-aversion, optimism,
savouring) directly affect their expectations. We thus wish to
examine how people actually form expectations, how those
expectations change as an event unfolds, and how important those
conscious expectations are in determining risk-taking behavior.

This study exploits a novel experimental design to assess
expectation formation during the unfolding of an uncertain event
whose outcome matters.  Participants were confronted with six
animated car race games, where their payoff was linked to the
outcome of one particular car. In each game, a participant chose how
to divide a fixed amount of money---earned previously in a real
effort task---into a wagered amount and an invested amount, where
investment increased the chances that the participant's car would
win.  Each race lasted for ten laps and consisted of five cars in
total, each of which ran according to a statistical process that
consisted of a random-walk component and an exogenous downward
shifter (denoting a temporary `engine failure'), the latter of which
was reduced in frequency for the participant's car in proportion to
the invested amount. Participants were offered the choice to
withdraw from their bet at each of three pitstops (after laps 3, 6,
and 9) and retain a fraction of their initial bet with certainty.
Participants' expectations about the likelihood of their car winning
were solicited at the beginning of the race as well as during the
pitstops, by asking them how many times out of 1000 they thought
their car would win, based on its current position relative to the
other cars.  One of the six races, chosen randomly, was paid out in
cash at the conclusion of the experiment.

There were four distinct treatments, each of which affected the way
the payoffs were structured. In the baseline treatment, participants
received a \$5 show up fee, and 5 times the amount bet in the event
that their car won and the given race was selected to be paid out.
In the `wealth' treatment, the payoffs from the races stayed the
same, but the show-up fee was increased to \$20. In the
`high-stakes' treatment, the show-up fee was again \$5 but
participants would win 15 times the amount bet if their car won and
that race was selected to be paid out. Finally, in the `low-stakes'
treatment, participants received twice the bet if their car won, the
wagered amount exactly if their car came second, and half of the
wagered amount if their car came third.

In addition to the information about expectations and risk-taking
provided by the race stage of the experiment, we asked participants
to respond to a number of question batteries regarding their
psychology and beliefs, and also collected standard demographic
information. After the experiment had concluded, we also simulated
the actual likelihood of a car winning the race from each pitstop,
providing an objective picture of the future outcome against which
we could compare participants' expectations. In this paper, we use
all of these diverse sources of data to model both expectation
formation and risk-taking behavior.

\section{Simple statistics}
A total of 239 participants took part in the eight sessions of the
experiment. All of them were recruited using the OrSEE
system\footnote{Add to .bib file:  Ben Greiner (2004): An Online
Recruitment System for Economic Experiments. In: Kurt Kremer, Volker
Macho (Hrsg.): Forschung und wissenschaftliches Rechnen. GWDG
Bericht 63. GWDG, Gï¿½ttingen, 79-93. Then this footnote should read,
write "Participants were recruited using the recruitment system
ORSEE (Greiner 2004).".} from the UNSW ASBLab's subject pool using a
standard email. The average age of participants was 22 years, and
45.15\% of the participants were female. The average earnings in the
real effort task, which was then split into a wagered amount and an
invested amount, was \$24.42. The average bet was \$7.23 dollars, and
there was a steep winning curve: payoffs were highly volatile,
ranging from \$5 to \$105.20, with an average of \$23.62
across all four treatments.

Full sample sizes by treatment at the levels of the participant, the
participant-by-race, and the participant-by-pitstop are shown in
Table \ref{sumstats}.  All regressions in the present paper are
performed at the participant-by-pitstop level.  Sample sizes in
ensuing regression tables fluctuate somewhat due to incomplete data
for some participants on some explanatory variables.

\section{Approach}
Our approach is very simple.  To explore how expectations are
formed, we regress participants' expectations, reported at the
pitstops, on the following sources of variation: (1) demographics
(including information on the standard economic constructs of wealth
and income); (2) actual, objective chances of the car winning (drawn
from the simulations) and other race- and session-specific
contextual factors; and (3) psychological factors. From the results
of these regressions we can determine the extent to which
participants' expectations are driven by factors other than the true
likelihood of winning, and which amongst the above sources of
variation is most salient in driving expectations.

Secondly, we predict the likelihood of dropping out using both
expectations and all other variables included in the model of
expectations.  This allows us to examine the strength of the link
between expectations themselves, versus other attributes of the
person, and actual risk-taking behavior.

We also employ participant fixed effects in an extension of both
models, in order to determine how consistent people are over time in
terms of their expectation formation and their actual risk-taking
behavior.

\section{Results}

Main points to emphasize:
\begin{itemize}
\item Expectations are higher than the truth, and variant across people,
together implying that the model of `rational expectations' is
almost certainly wrong. Evidence for this: (1) actual winning
percentage alone leaves about 30\% of the variance in expectations
unexplained; (2) people provide overestimates on average (see strong
positive coefficients on session type variables reflecting positive
pressure which otherwise is soaked up by a positive and significant
constant term, as well as means of expectations vs simulated
likelihoods of winning).
\item Psychological factors, including variance captured by aspects
of the individual's personal belief system (e.g., lucky charms,
religion, vegetarianism) are overall just as if not more predictive
of expectation formation as more traditional `economic' variables
(e.g., income, wealth, education).  Evidence for this: First table
of results.  Note that i have included some marginally economic
variables, like nationality, in the list of ``economic" variables
for the sake of conservatism towards the null hypothesis that
economic variables should be more important, but we could switch
this.
\item Expectations are significantly associated with actual
risk-taking behavior, casting doubt on the hypothesis that optimism
is due to persistent experimenter bias of some description rather
than reflecting actual human tendency towards enhanced expectations.
The association between expectations and risk-taking behavior
persists even when participant fixed effects and actual likelihood
of success are controlled, implying that ephemeral factors unrelated
to real risks or personal idiosyncracies can play an important role
in shaping economic decisions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Are expectations rational?}

The experiment described above places participants into identical
conditional risk states---where the simulated true likelihood of
winning, as well as a number of other contextual factors about the
particular race, are completely controlled and cleanly observed by
the experimenter.  It follows that systematic deviations in
participants' conditional expectation away from the simulated
likelihood of winning must indicate that either (1) all participants
were subjected to some common shock (e.g., a reaction to the
experimenter) which accounted for higher- or lower-than-reality
expectations to be reported; or (2) participants are not rationally
reacting to the information presented to them.

It is already clear in Table \ref{sumstats} that on average,
participants' expectations of winning likelihoods exceed the
simulated likelihoods of winning.  Table \ref{t2} shows the results
of participant-pitstop level regressions predicting expectations of
winning, where constants are omitted due to our \emph{a priori}
hypothesis that the simulated likelihoods of winning should line up
linearly with participants' expectations of winning.\footnote{If
constants are included, R-squared values fall dramatically and
constant terms have positive and significant estimates across the
board.} Columns 1 and 2 of Table \ref{t2} show immediate evidence
that simulated (read: actual) winning percentages are not the only
factor driving expectation formation. About 71\% of the combined
within- and across-participant variance in expectation formation can
be explained by simulated likelihoods of winning alone. When
additional aspects of race context are added---which should not be
systematically related to expectation formation, if expectations
reflect actual likelihoods alone---these additional variables
contribute roughly another 11\% of the variation in expectations,
with the coefficients on the session type controls showing upward
pressure from pervasive optimism. This finding is in strong
accordance with previous research \textbf{ADD CITES} that has found
people to over-estimate their likelihood of encountering good
outcomes in the future.  While this finding is therefore not new, it
is striking inasmuch as given the design of our experiment where no
action on the part of the participant can influence the outcome,
only two explanations for this systematic over-estimation exist:  it
either reflects the influence of non-economic forces (such as ideals
and habits of mind), or it constitutes a systematic reporting bias
which also occurs in the survey data used in previous studies, such
as those cited above, that have found people to be optimists on
average.

\subsection{What drives expectation formation across people?}

Columns 2 through 5 of Table \ref{t2} show which specific observable
variables explain the remaining variance in expectation formation
across and within people. Once actual winning likelihood is
controlled and persistent unrealistic optimism is accommodated
through the session type variables, even our exceptionally full
complement of observable characteristics is only able to explain a
few percentage points of additional variation in expectation
formation.  If we group the remaining explanatory variables into two
categories---standard demographics (appearing in the middle of the
table) and psychology (appearing at the bottom of the table)---then
we see that the standard demographic variables, which include
gender, age, income category, and an array of education and
background variables, are as a group roughly as powerful as the
psychological variables in explaining expectation formation. Column
5 shows that when both the standard demographics and the psychology
variables are included in the regression, the estimated coefficients
on many of the standard demographic variables, such as income,
wealth, and parental education, change strikingly in magnitude and
even significance. This implies that these economic variables, that
have been found in past studies to influence risk-taking behavior
\textbf{ADD CITES}, are partly capturing the influence of learned or
in-born psychological traits that are correlated with those economic
variables.

\textbf{Add some interpretations of the econ variables if we want
to.}  In terms of particular psychological variables of importance,
savouring, self-esteem, optimism, depression, being happy and being
a vegetarian all significantly predict the level of expectations
formed in Column 5 of Table \ref{t2}.

\subsection{Do expectations influence risk-taking behavior?}

We find strong evidence that expectations relate to drop-out
behavior, over and above the contribution of other variables,
including the objective likelihood of success.  This is shown in
Table \ref{t4}, which displays marginal effects from a logit model
estimated using all participant-pitstop observations where the
participant had either not dropped out, or had dropped out at that
pitstop for the first time in the given race.\footnote{This sample
exclusion was to avoid the sour grapes effect.  Explain.}

The main conclusion we draw from the results in this table is that
expectations of success predict risk-aversive behavior \emph{even
when the actual likelihood of success is controlled.} The estimates
from our preferred model (Column 5) imply that the impact of an
increase in expectations by one standard deviation (equivalent to an
increase of approximately 3 scaled points in how many times the car
is estimated to win out of 10) is associated with a fall in the
participant's likelihood of dropping out of about 4\%.  In terms of
the economic magnitude of the responsiveness of dropout behavior to
expectations versus reality, we conservatively estimate the
influence of expectations of winning likelihood to be about half the
size of the impact of actual winning likelihood.

The fact that actual winning percentages and expected winning
percentages are not the only factors that explain dropout behavior
implies that some component of risk-taking is due to person- or
context-specific factors that influence risk-taking behavior through
a mechanism other than expectation formation.  Table \ref{t4} shows
that the most important such factors that we are able to observe in
our data are type of session, car color, schooling level, being
happy, and having a lucky charm.  Since expectations of winning
should capture all of the economic reasons to behave in a
risk-averse or risk-loving way, it is to be expected that there
should be no independent effect of our economic variables on risk
averse behavior once expectations are taken into account.  Overall,
we find this to be the case.

\subsection{Discussion}

In sum, we find that approximately 70\% of expectation formation is
`rational' in the sense of lining up with the actual likelihood of a
positive event.  Non-economic variables including information about
the race context and psychological factors such as incidence of
depression, self-esteem, inherent optimism, and information about
ideals (such as whether is a vegetarian) are related to expectation
formation. Most of the impact of both our standard and `alternative'
demographics on actual risk-taking behavior flows through
expectation formation.

Overall, our results provide support for several main contentions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Regardless of their psychology, people are alike in forming expectations in a manner that is
inconsistent with reality:  on average, they are unrealistically
optimistic.
\item These unrealistic expectations are meaningfully linked to people's risk-taking behavior.
\item While aspects of the risk-taking context do influence expectation formation in predictable ways,
psychological factors are at least as important as economic
variables in explaining expectation formation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Experimental procedures}
The experiment was structured in several stages. First, participants
were asked to respond to a number of question batteries regarding
their psychology.  These included measures of self-esteem, locus of
control, savouring (the ability to draw pleasure from the past, the
present, and the future), and overall optimism.  Then, there was a
five-minute meditation phase where participants listened to a
relaxing voiceover, followed by wave sounds.\footnote{This phase was
included in order to obtain a benchmark for the heart-rate variation
of a subset of participants who were connected to portable
heart-rate monitoring devices.  The information collected by these
devices is not used in the present paper.} Next, participants had to
earn their initial income in a real effort task, to generate
ownership of the amount that would be bet or invested.  An extensive
introduction into the car race procedure was then provided, with a
voiceover guide through all screens and two test races in which
participants could familiarize themselves with the process. This was
followed by the actual car race phase.  After six rounds of car
races, participants' accuracy in predicting the outcome was again
measured in an incentivized way, where more accurate predictions
yielded higher payoffs. The experiment concluded with a detailed
demographics questionnaire.  \textbf{Add screenshots and link to
above text.}

\subsection{Question items}
The following procedures and item sets were used to measure the demographic and psychological factors controlled for in this study.
\begin{itemize}
\item{Self-esteem.}  Self-esteem was measured as the average, for each participant, of responses to the ten questions that appear below, where questions x through z were first reverse-coded.
\item{Medication.}  A dummy taking the value of 1 if the participant answered Yes to the question, ``Blah?".
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Self-esteem questions}
Blah (from survey).
