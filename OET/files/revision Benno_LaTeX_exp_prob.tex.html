\begin{abstract}
We examine the nature of stated subjective probabilities in a complex,
evolving context in which true event probabilities are not within subjects'
explicit information set. Specifically, we collect information on subjective
expectations in a car race wherein participants must bet on a particular car
but cannot influence the odds of winning once the race begins. In our setup,
the actual probability of the good outcome (a win) can be determined based
on computer simulations from any point in the process. We compare this
actual probability to the subjective probability provided by participants at
three different points in each of 6 races. In line with previous research in which
participants have direct access to actual probabilities, we find that the inverse S-shaped curve
relating subjective to actual probabilities is also evident in our
far more complex situation, and that there is only a limited degree of
learning through repeated play. We show that the model in the S-shaped function family that provides the best fit to our data is Prelec's %
\citeyear{prelec_98} conditional invariant model.

\section{Introduction}

The quality of human judgment has been comprehensively explored in various
disciplines, including psychology, management, and economics. The vast
literature on non-expected utility theory
\citeaffixed[for a
review]{starmer_00,starmer_04}{see} originated in the
persistent inability of rational models of behavior \cite{neumann_47} to
predict choice behavior in experiments \cite{camerer_04}. Among the early
evidence for this inability was the Allais paradox, derived during a canonical
experiment in which subjects were asked their preferences between a lottery
with chance $x$ of winning prize $X$ (getting zero with chance $1 - x$) and
a lottery with chance $y$ of winning prize $Y$ (again with zero as the
alternative). One (seemingly mild) condition of rationality was that anyone
preferring the first lottery over the second should also prefer the first
over the second of an amended version of both lotteries in which the chances
of winning were changed, respectively, to $x * c$ and $y * c$. The frequent
violation of this condition spawned a cottage industry of further choice
experiments to tease out individuals' cognitive biases in lottery playing.

One prominent finding from this literature is that even when told the
actual probabilities associated with outcomes, individuals behave as though
other probabilities apply. Early experimental work by \citeasnoun{preston_48}, for example, identified an inverted S-shaped function in which subjective
(psychological) probabilities exceed objective (mathematical) probabilities
at low values of $p$ but fall short of objective probabilities at high
values of $p$ (seen pictorially in Figure \ref{kernelallraces}). They
explain this observation by relating it to another psychological study in
which participants' perception of the brightness of a stimulus varied in
proportion to a comparison, or `anchor', level of brightness. \possessivecite{preston_48} core proposal was that the crossing point in their
experimental data (the point at which the subjective and objective probabilities were
equal) was a function of an initial anchoring level, which itself may relate
to inherent psychological or physiological attributes and the initial
endowment (p.\ 191-192). In their experiment, the inverted S-shape was not only
visible in student data but also in data from faculty of mostly professorial
rank in the fields of mathematics, statistics, and psychology; participants who presumably had many
years of acquaintance with probability theory. Subsequent work by
\citeasnoun{dale_59} also reported that experimental subjects tend to
overestimate low probabilities and underestimate high probabilities.

Since then, a raft of theories---including prospect theory \cite%
{kahnemann_79}, rank-dependent utility theory \cite%
{quiggin_82,yaari_87,schmeidler_89,wakker_94}, adaptive probability theory
\cite{martins_06}, and conditional small world theory \cite{chew_08}---have
proposed specific cognitive decision rules regarding how subjective probabilities
are derived from objective ones. Contrary to expected utility (EU) theory,
however, these approaches treat actual probabilities as nonlinear inputs to
subjective probabilities. Moreover, despite being axiomatically based, each
has become associated with a particular probability-weighting function that
relates the subjective probability $p^{s}$ to the true probability $p$.
These weighting functions are consistent with the psychophysics of
diminishing sensitivity, wherein the marginal impact of a stimulus
diminishes with increasing distance from a reference point \cite%
{tversky_92,camerer_95,fox_03}. They may also reflect affective aspects of
the decision process, such as hope (when contemplating high-probability
losses) or fear (when contemplating low-probability losses), which could
imply that the more pronounced the S-shape, the more emotionally rich the
decision-making situation \cite{rottenstreich_01,trepel_05}.

The most popular probability weighting function is $p^{s}=\frac{(p)^{\gamma }}{\sum_{j}(p_{j})^{\gamma }}$, where $\gamma < 1$ and $j$ enumerates all
possible outcomes an individual might consider. This function's most salient
characteristic is that small probabilities are over-weighted and large
probabilities are under-weighted, particularly if there is a large number of possible
outcomes. A similar function proposed by \citeasnoun{quiggin_82}
and used explicitly in \citeasnoun{tversky_92} has subsequently been
employed for estimation in dozens of experiments %
\citeaffixed{machina_04}{see}. This line of research has produced increasing
evidence that the use of a weighting function enables a far better fit to
how the brain processes probabilities of a set of outcomes than
can be generated from the purely rational model \cite{berns_08}. In fact, %
\citeasnoun{camerer_04} stress that `the statistical evidence against EU is
so overwhelming that it is pointless to run more studies testing EU against
alternative theories (as opposed to comparing theories with one another)'
(p.\ 20). The research evidence also suggests that the elevation of the
weighting function (i.e., the degree of over- or under-weighting that it
features) may be linked to individuals' impulsiveness, and thus to the
dopaminergic and serotonergic systems \cite{trepel_05}.

We contribute to the branch of literature that does not 
try to estimate a probability weighting function based on informing
individuals of an outcome's true probability, and then observing their
choice behavior \citeaffixed{abdellaoui2011rich,kilka2001determines}{see, e.g.,}. As \citeasnoun{abdellaoui2011rich} points out "[i]n many situations we do not know the probabilities of uncertain events that are relevant for the outcomes of our decisions" (p. 695). We are generally faced with decisions characterized by partial knowledge of the consequences \cite{tversky1995weighing}.  However, studies often provide individuals with information regarding an outcome's true probability, a strategy that was criticized at least 18 years ago by \citeasnoun{fox1998belief}: "Although most empirical studies have employed risky prospects, where probabilities are assumed to be known, virtually all real-world decisions (with the notable exception of games of chance) involve uncertain prospects (e.g., investments, litigation, insurance) where this assumption does not hold. In order to model such decisions we need to extend the key features of the risky weighting function to the domain of uncertainty" (p. 880). For example, a typical experiment might present the following scenario:

\begin{quote}
You participate in two lotteries. The first gives you a A\% chance of
winning \$250, while the second gives you a (A+25)\% chance of winning the
same amount. Which of the following options seems like a more significant
change in the odds?

1) Increase your chance of winning the first lottery from A\% to (A+5)\%

2) Increase your chance of winning the second lottery from (A+25)\% to
(A+30)\%
\end{quote}

(adapted from p.\ 130 of \citeasnoun{gonzalez_99}).

To the purely rational person, the answer would be that there is no
difference. Yet, consistent with the S-shaped function discussed above,
students given this question tend to pick option 1 when A is small (5\%) and
option 2 when A is large (65\%).

As with many economic problems, probabilities are not really given \citeaffixed{gilboa2008probability}{see also}, prompting \citeasnoun{de2008risk} to state that: "One crucial piece of information distinguishes experimental from observational data. In experiments involving risky situations, knowledge of the probability of events is assumed, and these probabilities can vary. In observational data, subjective probabilities about future events are unknown" (p. 280). However, empirical tests in real-world situations are fraught with identification problems \cite{gilboa2008probability}. On the other hand, experiments have been criticized as somewhat artificial \cite{winkler1991ambiguity}. Thus, in this experimental paper we confront individuals with scenarios that more closely resemble
real-life decision-making contexts, in which the actual probability of
success is not within individuals' feasible information set. As \citeasnoun{machina1992more} point out, real-world uncertainty does not really present itself in the form of exogenously specified probabilities. A bet as an object of choice is a more typical representation allowing the exploration of subjective uncertainty or subjective probabilities. We estimate the
probability weighting function in a novel experimental situation that asks
individuals for their estimates of the probability of a good outcome in a
complex situation. While it is not impossible to correctly ascertain the actual probability of a
good outcome---participants receive all the
information needed to calculate it---is extremely difficult. Thus, we contribute to the literature on people's intuitive judgments of likelihood \cite{gilovich2002heuristics} that measures the probability weighting function in the case of uncertainty \citeaffixed{tversky1995risk,fox1998belief,kilka2001determines,holt2009update,wakker2010prospect,abdellaoui2011rich,baillon2012aggregating}{see, e.g.,}. Ambiguity has become a central topic for exploration in the social sciences, and it has become evident that flexible and rich tools are required \cite{abdellaoui2011rich}.  We contribute to the literature on the relationship between subjective probabilities and actual outcomes \citeaffixed{manski2004measuring,hurd2009subjective,carman2014probability}{see, e.g.,}. 

Obviously, there is a large literature on probability judgments. For example, there has been a strong focus on exploring the coherence of probability judgments and its correspondence to the actual likelihood of outcomes \citeaffixed{brenner2002remarks}{see, e.g., support theory}. Overall, studies using survey data dominate this literature \cite{de2008risk}. For our
purposes, we adapt a race car game in which participants must bet on the
ultimate outcome, which cannot be influenced once the game is underway, and we
ask subjects several times during each race what they think the odds are of
their chosen car winning the race.  Our set-up is thus dynamic---like the few
existing papers \citeaffixed{cheung_01}{e.g.} that examine dynamic,
probabilistic processes over time---and allows us to monitor how agents
update their probability expectations as a risky situation unfolds. This is an important feature of the study, as many interesting decision-making problems are dynamic in nature \cite{winkler1991ambiguity}. 

The novelty of our study compared to the previous literature is thus in presenting the elicitation in a dynamic and real setting where probabilities are unknown to the subjects but known to us as researchers. We are therefore able to observe updating of uncertain probabilities. This allows us to gain further empirical insights into the determinants of subjective probabilities and how subjective probabilities relate to objective probabilities in a dynamic environment. Consistent with \citeasnoun{baillon2013learning} we observe that with more information (e.g., more experience in our case) the weighting function gets steeper over time (reduced likelihood of insensitivity). Other (more static) settings usually find more likelihood insensitivity\footnote{For a formal definition and discussion of likelihood insensitivity (inverse-S shape) see \citeasnoun{wakker2010prospect}, chapter 7.} for uncertainty than risk \citeaffixed{baillon2013learning}{for a list of studies see}. However, overall we only find a limited degree of learning through repeated play. 

A possible criticism of our experimental setting is that it is not rich in feedback and challenging, but such circumstances are not uncommon in reality. There is a growing literature that explores learning under ambiguity \cite{epstein2007learning} and a push towards trying to apply more realistic models of the way beliefs are formed and the way they are updated \cite{gilboa2008probability}.There is also a strong demand for experimental research in choice situations involving ambiguity \cite{de2008risk}. The quality of people's assessments, their abilities, and limits of their functioning in uncertain environments are of theoretical and applied importance \cite{lichtenstein1977those}. Moreover, in many repeated economic situations we observe that there is a proportion of agents that have no previous experience with the situation \cite{haltiwanger1985rational}. Conducting experiments permits the assumption that all agents have the same context experience under exploration. It may also be worthwhile to note that such uncertainty due to imperfect foresight and human inability to solve complex problems has been at the core of revisions to the use of optimization strategies in understanding human actions \cite{alchian1950uncertainty}. Using this setting wherein bets on winning a simulated car race is interesting as it mimics the original subjective probability discussion that emerged many decades ago, comparing such uncertain events to (horse) races \citeaffixed{roma1931sul,anscombe1963definition,heilig1978carnap} {see, e.g.,}.

We check the validity of the elicited probabilities by comparing them
against a set of incentivized choices that we allow participants to make at
the same moments when their subjective probabilities are elicited. Subjects
may choose at these moments whether or not to pull out of the game, where
pulling out involves recouping a fraction of their bet for sure rather than
letting the race run its course and risking the loss of their whole bet.
This check also allows us to determine whether stated probabilities have
information value in terms of actual decision-making behavior involving a
trade-off between costs or benefits known now with certainty, versus risky
future outcomes \cite{palma_08}. Such choices are exemplified in the TV game
show \emph{Deal Or No Deal}, in which the tradeoff is between a safe option
(receiving a sum of money for certain) and an opportunity to win more or
less \citeaffixed{post_08,bombardini_12,mulino_09,roos_10,deck_08,botti_08,blavatskyy_08,palma_08,andersen_13}{e.g.}. 
We avoid the danger that risk aversion will lead individuals to
misrepresent their probability perceptions and therefore contaminate the data \cite{andersen_10} by separating
their choice behavior from their stated probabilities, and only
incentivizing the former \citeaffixed{schlag2013penny}{for a recent  evaluation of different belief elicitation methods see}. The opinions whether or not to use incentives for belief elicitation are divided. In our context we are also keen to keep the pit stop decision and evaluation process low in cognitive load and it is unclear why subjects should have a clear incentive to misreport. Experiments where subjects can use stated beliefs to justify their (selfish) behavior to the experiments are more problematic (e.g., dictator games, public good games and trust games \cite{schlag2013penny}). The stability of the results obtained over time and the consistency with other studies in other contexts may indicate that misunderstandings or careless reporting are not an issue in our context and data, despite the complexity of the task. 

In sum, a central contribution of this paper is the estimation of a probability
weighting function that maps the true probability, unobserved by the
subject, against a perceived probability that is self-reported in a dynamic and real setting. We find that despite the significant complexity of the
scenario and the absence of direct information about actual probabilities,
the inverted S-shaped probability weighting function discussed above fits the data
remarkably well.



\section{Theoretical framework}

We begin by writing down estimable functions that link subjective
probability with objective probability in a dichotomous choice setting.
Being agnostic about which of the many functions proposed in the literature
best captures real behavior, we consider four of the most prominent
specifications of how $p_{it}^{s}$, the subjective probability of a good
outcome stated by individual $i$ at time $t$, relates to the objective
probability of a good outcome, $p_{it}$.

Our first model uses the same set-up as employed in \citeasnoun{lattimore_92} and %
\citeasnoun{gonzalez_99}:
\begin{equation}
p_{it}^{s}=\frac{\alpha p_{it}^{\gamma }}{\alpha p_{it}^{\gamma
}+(1-p_{it})^{\gamma }}+v_{it}
\end{equation}
Model (1), alluded to in the introduction and widely discussed in the
literature, is a log-odds linear representation of the relation between $%
p_{it}$ and $p_{it}^{s}$. Here, the parameter $\gamma < 1$ measures the
change in sensitivity of the subjective probability to changes in the
objective probability as the latter increases (controls curvature). $%
\alpha$ is primarily responsible for the curve's elevation, and measures the
relative level of optimism \cite{bruhin_10}. The weighting function becomes
more elevated as $\alpha$ increases and more curved as $\gamma$ decreases
\cite{trepel_05}. The error term $v_{it}$ is standard normally distributed
throughout, with unknown variance $\sigma$.

Our second model is taken from \citeasnoun{wu_96}:
\begin{equation}
p_{it}^{s}=\frac{p_{it}^{\gamma }}{[p_{it}^{\gamma }+(1-p_{it})^{\gamma
}]^{\alpha }}+v_{it}
\end{equation}
Model (2) is a reduction of the \citeasnoun{lattimore_92} model in the event
that, in the prior model, $\alpha =1$. Similar to the work by \citeasnoun{camerer_94} and %
\citeasnoun{tversky_92}, \citeasnoun{wu_96} estimate only one parameter of
Model (2) ($\gamma$, with $\alpha=1/\gamma$) instead of two. In a later
article \cite{gonzalez_99}, the authors argue that although curvature and
elevation are two independent aspects of the function of
interest and can be captured separately using these two parameters, they are not perfectly represented by a single parameter
in this parametric form.

The third model is Prelec's \citeyear{prelec_98} compound invariant model of
$p_{it}^{s}$ based on a particular axiomatic representation of choices
between lotteries:\footnote{%
The key preference axiom related to the compound invariant model is that,
using ($x_{k},q_{k}$) to denote a lottery in which the actual outcome $x_{k}$
eventuates with probability $q_{k},$ it must hold that if ($x_{1},q_{1}$)$%
\sim $($x_{2},q_{2}$) and ($x_{1},q_{3}$)$\sim $($x_{2},q_{4}$) then ($%
x_{3},(q_{1})^{M}$)$\sim $($x_{4},(q_{2})^{M}$) implies ($x_{3},(q_{3})^{M}$)%
$\sim $($x_{4},(q_{4})^{M}$) with M$\geq $1.}

\begin{equation}
p_{it}^{s}=\gamma \exp {[-\beta (-\ln p_{it})^{\alpha }]}+v_{it}
\end{equation}
Model (3) essentially allows for much flatter S-shapes, and breaks away from
the assumption that when $p_{it}$ approaches 1, perceived and real
probabilities must be the same (note in this function that when ${%
p_{it}\downarrow 0}$ then $p_{it}^{s}=0$, but when ${p_{it}=1}$, $%
p_{it}^{s}=\gamma$). As \citeasnoun{palma_08} point
out, the parameter $\beta$ reflects pessimism, whereas $\alpha$ reflects the degree to which the S-shape is pronounced (p.\ 278). Prelec describes the $\alpha$ parameter as an Allais
Paradox Index (pp.\ 78-79), providing information about individuals'
propensities to generate expected utility violations: `If one person has a
weighting function that intersects another person's function from above,
then that person will commit more Allais common-ratio violations and more
Allais common-consequence violations' (p.\ 79). According to some
neuro-scientific research, $\alpha$ is linked to the anterior cingulate
cortex of the brain, being correlated with greater activation in this area
\cite{paulus_06}.

The fourth model we estimate is Prelec's \citeyear{prelec_98} conditional
invariant model of $p_{it}^{s}$:\footnote{%
The key axiom related to the conditional invariant model is that, with $0
<\lambda <1$, it would have to hold that if $(x_{1},q_{1}) \sim
(x_{2},q_{2}) $ and $(x_{1},q_{3}) \sim (x_{2},q_{4})$, then $(x_{3},\lambda
q_{1}) \sim (x_{4},\lambda q_{2})$ implies $(x_{3},\lambda q_{3}) \sim
(x_{4},\lambda q_{4})$.}

\begin{equation}
p_{it}^{s}=\gamma \exp {[-}\frac{{\beta }}{\eta }{(1-p_{it}^{\eta })]}+v_{it}
\end{equation}
Although the overall properties of Model (4) are similar to those of the
compound invariant model near the extremities of the distribution, Model (4)
allows for a slightly different shape. According to \citeasnoun{prelec_00},
Models (3) and (4) offer two distinct advantages: they rationalize different
classes of expected utility violations simultaneously, and they are
tractable.

In the empirical estimation, we first seek the model that best explains our
subjective probability data, and then proceed to estimate the
determinants of the deep parameters of that model. We also note that for the
top three of these models it holds that rationality (i.e., the classic
expected utility framework under which $p_{it}^{s}=p_{it}$ along the entire
range of $p_{it}$) would require that the deep parameters are all equal to
unity---i.e., that $\alpha = \beta = \gamma ={1}$. The fourth model does not
allow for such rationality within the possible parameter space, but does
impose rationality at the boundaries ($p_{it}^s=0$ when $p_{it}=0$ and $%
p_{it}^s=1$ when $p_{it}=1$) when $\gamma = 1$.

\section{Experimental design}

To assess expectation formation during the unfolding of an uncertain event
whose outcome matters, we use a novel experimental design; the scientific
motivation and relevant features are outlined here. Further details are
available in the Appendix and upon request from the authors.

\subsection{Motivation}

Our context is intended to mimic a real-life situation, such as gambling or
stock trading, in which the agent may observe initial information about
statistical likelihoods or even provide input into the outcome generation
process, but cannot perfectly anticipate a shock component present in the
process before the outcome occurs. The parameters of non-expected utility
models have been empirically estimated in previous studies of such real-life
situations, with early research frequently using betting markets to explore
the subjective and estimated objective winning probabilities \cite%
{griffith_49,mcglothlin_56,weitzman_65,ali_77}. For
example, in a study of 20,247 harness horse races, \citeasnoun{ali_77}, shows that the winning
probability for a horse with a low objective probability of winning is
overstated, whereas the winning probability for a horse with a high
objective probability of winning is understated. \citeasnoun{jullien_00},
using U.K.\ data on 34,443 horse races, also compute econometric estimates
of non-expected utility models. They find evidence that representations
based on cumulative prospect theory perform better than those derived from
expected utility, which perform as well or worse than those based on
rank-dependent expected utility. Among the cumulative prospect theory
models, they find that the \citeasnoun{prelec_98} models fit the data best.
This implies that expected utility should be rejected in favor of Prelec's
alternatives even though, in \citeasnoun{jullien_00}, the estimated
weighting function was close to the diagonal, implying only limited economic
significance of the deviation from rationality.

Yet, when looking at such real markets, scholars also find other
considerations to be of likely importance. For example, \citeasnoun{golec_98}
suggest that bettors are risk averse, where in terms of the actual
distribution of expected winnings, they trade off both variance and negative
expected return in favor of positive skewness. This is exactly counter to
what one would expect if bettors are using S-shaped weighting functions,
because it implies that bettors willingly take very small risks of huge
losses in order to gain higher probabilities of winning. Yet it is precisely
what one would expect once one takes into account the possibility of
bankruptcy, which provides a real-life floor beneath which outcomes cannot
go. Another disadvantage of most real markets is that there is no
unambiguous `true probability' to which behavior can be related, as the
statistician only has access to realized events and not to the underlying true
probabilities of these events. The results and limitations of earlier studies thus
suggest the use of real-life experimental designs implemented in the lab,
which have the advantages of conferring control over the risky data generating process, offering a richer set of variables capturing individual characteristics, and ensuring the absence of other potentially confounding factors, such as bankruptcy laws.

\subsection{Design}

In our experiment, participants were confronted with six animated race car
games, where each participant's final payoff was linked to the outcome of
one particular car.\footnote{Each participant faced his own game involving competing cars controlled by
the computer, with no interactions between the races or with the games of
different participants. The experiment was programmed in an early version of
CORAL \cite{schaffner_2013}.} In each game, the participant chose how to
divide a fixed amount of money---earned previously in a real-effort task
consisting of cross-sum calculations---into a wagered amount and an invested
amount, where greater investment increased the chances that the
participant's car would win (see Figure \ref{FigureA1} in the Appendix).
Each race lasted for 10 laps and involved five cars in total (see Figure \ref{FigureA2}), each performing according to a statistical process comprised of a
random-walk component and an exogenous downward shifter, explained to
participants as a temporary engine failure. The frequency of the incidence
of this exogenous downward shock was reduced for the participant's car in
proportion to the amount invested, explained to participants as investment
into engine quality. Participants were offered the choice to withdraw from
their bet at each of three pit stops (after laps 3, 6, and 9; see Figure \ref%
{FigureA2}). If they elected to drop out at one of these points, then they
would retain a fraction of the amount originally wagered. This fraction,
respectively at each successive pit stop, was 40\%, 25\%, or 10\% of the
amount originally wagered. Upon a decision to drop out, the participant
would see the race continue to completion on the screen, but would no longer
have a monetary stake in its outcome. Participants' expectations about the
likelihood of their car winning were elicited at the beginning of the race,
and also at each of the three pit stops, by asking them how many times out of 1,000
they thought their car would win if the race were to continue 1,000 times
from that point. The outcome of one of the six races, chosen randomly, was
paid out in cash at the conclusion of the experiment.

To obtain data across different risk and endowment levels, we implemented
four distinct treatments, each of which affected the way in which payoffs
were structured. In the baseline treatment, participants received a \$5
show-up fee plus five times the amount wagered in the event that their car
won the race that was selected for payout. In the `wealth' treatment, the
payoffs from the races stayed the same, but the show-up fee was increased to
\$20. In the `high-stakes' treatment, the show-up fee was again \$5 but
participants won 15 times the amount wagered if their car won the race that
was selected for payout. Finally, in the `low-stakes' treatment,
participants received twice the bet if their car won, the exact amount
wagered if their car came second, and half the wagered amount if their car
came third. For the purposes of this paper, we simply code these treatments
as separate parameters.

In addition to the information about expectations and risk-taking provided
in the race stage of the experiment, we asked participants to respond to
several batteries of questions on their psychology and beliefs, and also
collected standard demographic information. After the experiment had
concluded, we used repetitions of the data-generating process to simulate
the actual likelihood for each race of the participant's car winning the
race from the point of each pit stop, providing an objective picture of the
future outcome against which we could compare participants' subjective
expectations. In our context, as in many real-life scenarios, the true
(mathematical) probability of winning changed as the race went on, because
of changes in the observed positions of the cars. We therefore expected that
subjective probabilities too would adjust as this new information became
available, and the revelation of whether or not the participant's car would
win grew ever closer.

At the start of the race, we informed each participant of the overall odds
of his car winning the race, conditional on his choice of how much of his
endowment to invest, and how much to wager.\footnote{%
The total endowment available to each participant for investing or betting
at the start of each race was earned by that participant in a real-effort
stage prior to the race stage of the experiment; see Appendix for details.}
Crucial to our experiment however, and unlike the literature we build on, we
did not tell participants the true (updated) mathematical expectation of
winning when they arrived at the pit stops. We asked participants for their
subjective probabilities sequentially as this complex situation unfolded,
rather than backing them out of lottery choices at a point in time.

\section{Simple statistics and model fit}

A total of 239 participants took part in eight experimental sessions, all
recruited using using ORSEE \cite{greiner_04} via standard emails from the
experimental subject pool at the ASBLab at the Australian School of Business
within the University of New South Wales. The average participant age was 22
years, and 45.15\% of participants were female. The average earnings in the
real effort task, which as described above could then be split into a
wagered and an invested amount, was \$24.42. The average bet was \$7.23, and
there was a steep winning curve: payoffs were highly volatile, ranging from
\$5 to \$105.20, with an average of \$23.62 across all four treatments. Full
sample sizes by treatment, calculated at the levels of participant,
participant-by-race, and participant-by-pit-stop are given in Table \ref%
{sumstats}. In ensuing regression tables, these sample sizes fluctuate
somewhat because of incomplete participant data on certain explanatory
variables.

\end{table}

The key trend to take from this descriptive table is the presence of
aggregate over-optimism:  participants report a belief that their car
will win 521 out of 1000 continuations, whereas the true number, found via
large-sample simulations, is 433 out of 1000. Subjective probabilities are
thus around 9 percentage points higher than objective ones on average, and this difference is statistically significant, given the small size of the associated standard errors.

Next, we look at the evolution of the raw relationship between the
subjective probability and the actual probability for each of the 6 races
individuals faced, with a special focus on whether or not the match between
subjective and objective probabilities improves as individuals learn more
about the race. In the kernel plots shown in Figure \ref{kernelallraces}, we
see that for all six races a very similar inverted S-shaped curve emerges, and casual
visual inspection does not indicate an obvious improvement in the fit as we
move from Race 1 to Race 6. Still, the regression slope is significantly
steeper for the later races (4-6) than for the earlier ones (1-3). A
particular feature evident in the plots for each race is that the subjective
probability does not clearly converge to 1 even when the real probability is
very close to 1. Also, subjective probability remains above the real
probability until the real probability reaches approximately 60\%.

\subsection{Is there information in stated probabilities?}

As discussed above, participants were given the choice at each pit stop to
either withdraw from the race and receive a certain percentage of the bet,
or let the game proceed further. The inclusion of this behavioral choice,
presented at the same time that we elicit subjective probabilities, enables
us to answer the preliminary question of whether stated probabilities
contain information about choice behavior. Because the decision of whether
to drop out involves the utility value of entertainment and excitement, we
should expect choice behavior to relate not solely to subjective
probability, but also to individual heterogeneity in entertainment value and
a complicated option value of continuing.\footnote{For the first two of three pit stops, the
option of continuing includes the possibility of dropping out later.}
Nevertheless, by examining whether subjective probabilities help explain
choices, we can determine whether they contain any choice-relevant
information over and above the effects of real probabilities.

If we concentrate on the decision made at the last pit stop---when there are
no future pit stops to anticipate---we can run more detailed
specifications without being worried about the complication of the option
value of future dropout opportunities. The optimal strategy in this
situation, for a risk-neutral individual in any treatment except `low stakes' who is interested only in monetary reward,
is to drop out of the race if the probability of winning is below $\frac{10}{f}$\, where $f$ denotes the factor by which the wagered amount is
multiplied if the participant's car wins (5 or 15 times, depending on the
treatment) and the numerator captures the 10\% fraction of the wagered
amount that is paid out when dropping out at the final pit stop.

\end{table}

The first two columns of Table \ref{Dropouts}, where real and subjective
stated probabilities are used to predict dropout behavior either at all the
pit stops (Column 1) or only at the final pit stop (Column 2), clearly
illustrate that both real and stated probabilities affect the choice of
whether to drop out. Compared to specifications with only one
of the two types of probabilities included (shown in Columns 3 and 4), the
specification that includes both has a superior fit to the data both in
terms of raw log likelihood and in terms of the standard information
criteria (Bayesian, Aikake, and average likelihood ($\frac{-log(ll)}{N}$)).

Columns 5 to 7 then show the estimated effect on dropout behavior of the
objective or stated probability lying below the 10\% cutoff. Comparing these
results to the results in prior columns of Table \ref{Dropouts} reveals that
the contribution of subjective probabilities in explaining behavior is not
fully captured in the cutoffs alone: the log likelihood associated with the
model using only the cutoff dummies is substantially lower than that
associated with the model that includes the continuous probabilities. This
finding emphasizes that individuals do not make their choices purely on the
basis of maximizing expected monetary returns.

In the first two columns of Table \ref{Dropouts}, where we include both the
actual and stated probabilities, we find that the true probability's estimated coefficient is 50\% to 100\% higher than the subjective stated probability for the
latent variable related to the decision to drop out, and both variables are
highly significant in the equation.  This intriguing finding
indicates that participants use information reflected in the true
probability that is not included in their stated probability. We do not
explore this further here because there are many candidate
explanations for it that fall outside our focus in this paper, including
subliminal excitement due to unconscious awareness of additional
information, and non-linearities in the decision making process.

\section{Reduced form and structural analysis}

\subsection{Reduced form}

The conditional mean $E[p^{s}|p,X]$ of subjective probability is informative
in its own right, in that under perfect rationality $E[p^{s}|p,X]=p$,
meaning that deviations from this value throw light on the reduced-form
divergence between stated beliefs and what the rationality assumption
implies that beliefs `should' be. In Table \ref{bigOLS}, we show these
conditional means in the form of simple OLS regressions exploring the
relationship between subjective probabilities and objective probabilities,
with an increasing array of characteristics ($X$ variables) controlled.%
\footnote{%
As detailed in the Appendix, our Introductory and Follow-up Questionnaires
collected a vast array of information about participants. We selected the
particular control variables to include in the models shown in Table \ref%
{bigOLS} and Table \ref{paramML} based on a combination of goodness-of-fit
and coverage of the dimensions of the questionnaire. Adding additional power
terms of the objective probability to capture the non-linear relationship
improves the model fit only marginally (generating a 2-3\% increase in adjusted R$^2$).}

The results in the first four columns of Table \ref{bigOLS}
show that the coefficient on $p$ in the regression predicting $p^{s}$ hovers
around 0.4 to 0.5, with a standard deviation of 0.02 to 0.03, implying that
the coefficient is very significantly smaller than 1. This finding is
consistent with a systematic deviation from rationality. It suggests that on
balance, the net behavioral effect of increasing an event's probability when
that probability lies in the middle range---a real world example would be
the odds of one of two major political parties winning the next
election---will be much smaller than proportional to the actual change.

The estimated effects of our individual control variables on
subjective probability can be interpreted as capturing the estimated influence of
individual optimism, measured in different ways. Controlling for an array of
potential sources of individual optimism is particularly desirable in our
context because optimism (about a best outcome) or pessimism (about a worst
outcome) influences risk-related behavior \cite{abdellaoui_10}. Our findings
are generally in line with earlier research findings indicating that
wealthier and healthier respondents tend to be more optimistic. We find more
optimism among participants who are younger, have higher weekly incomes,
and/or are nonsmokers or vegetarians.

In weighing alternatives to the rationality assumption, it
is interesting to know not merely the conditional mean $E[p^{s}|p,X],$ but
also the standard deviation of $[p^{s}-E[p^{s}|p,X]|$,
which can serve as a measure of how tightly the subjective probabilities are
grouped around their conditional mean. The smaller the standard deviation, the more
`regular' the production of subjective probability. With this in mind, we
estimate next a slightly expanded reduced-form model that allows for both
heteroskedasticity and mean-level shifters. The main result of this
heteroskedasticity analysis, shown in the final two columns of Table \ref{bigOLS}, is that the effect of race number (1 through 6) on the standard
deviation has a coefficient of 0.002 ($sd=0.001$),
which means that the standard deviation of the subjective probabilities does
not fall with more races, indicating an absence of learning. Indeed, the
point estimate of this effect is positive, although it is insignificant at
all conventional levels. On the other hand, the coefficient of race number
on the mean subjectivity probability is -0.013 ($sd=0.002$) and significant
at the 1 percent level, meaning that the average stated probability goes
down over time, drawing closer to the average true probability. Hence, while
there is no learning in terms of a lowered standard deviation, the mean prediction error does reduce with time.

\subsection{Initial structural analysis}

Although the conditional means of subjective probability are
useful in reduced form for comparisons with what the rationality paradigm
implies, they cannot illuminate the deep structure of subjective probability
formation. To identify which proposed structure of the subjective
probability distribution fits our data best, we now horse-race the
theoretically-grounded subjective probability functions introduced above by
fitting each of our four models to the data, using a simple maximum
likelihood approach.

The results of these analyses are shown in Table \ref{bigML},
where models and parameters are identified by the model number and a
shorthand abbreviation based on the names of the authors who proposed the
model and---for the Prelec models---the model type. For Model (1) (the \citeasnoun{lattimore_92} model), the log likelihood is -319.676 and the
estimates for $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ are both significantly different from 1,
implying a strong aggregate S-shape that deviates from rationality. For
Model (2) (the \citeasnoun{wu_96} model), although the fit is slightly
superior to that of Model (1) (with a log likelihood of -316.616), the
structural results are somewhat similar: the estimate for $\gamma$ is 0.20
and significantly smaller than 1. Rationality is also violated in both the
compound invariant and conditional invariant models \cite{prelec_98}, with
all coefficient estimates significantly below 1, and with the stated
probability in Model (4) only about three-quarters ($\gamma = 0.74$) of the
real probability when the real probability is at the limit of 1. The log
likelihoods of Models (3) and (4) are -260.059 and -249.176, respectively.

We next statistically compare the results for each model using
the three most commonly used criteria: Akaike's information criterion (AIC),
the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and the average log likelihood. As
Table \ref{statcompare} shows, in all cases, Prelec's \citeyear{prelec_98}
conditional invariant model gives a superior fit by a large margin. Under
particular conditions, the AIC is chi-square distributed, making the
differences between models very significant not only in terms of sheer
likelihood ratios, but also at the conventional 1\% and even 0.01\% levels
of statistical significance. We therefore proceed in the next section to
parameterize this conditional invariant model.\footnote{Since the models are non-nested and have different basic structures, there
is no theoretically clear way to parameterize all four of them and then
compare results. Indeed, for all these models, full parameterization
engenders convergence issues because of the high degree of collinearity and
the associated problems of a flat likelihood. Nevertheless, if we limit
ourselves to structurally recovering only two parameters from the data for
each model (including the variance of the error term), Prelec's
\citeyear{prelec_98} conditional invariant model consistently delivers the
best fit across all selections of parameter pairs (using the same variables
from the data).}

As is suggested by the kernel plots of the subjective probabilities
against the objective probabilities in our data (Figure \ref{kernelallraces}), the main reason for the superior fit of Prelec's alternatives compared to
Models (1) and (2) is that both the compound and conditional invariant
models allow the switching point at which the 45-degree line is crossed to
be at any level of the real probability. In this case, visual inspection
reveals that the switching point lies above $p = 0.5$ in our data, while it
is estimated at closer to $p = 0.3$ when we fit Models (1) and (2) to the
data. Hence, the main data characteristic responsible for the superior fit
of Models (3) and (4) is that the subjective probability associated with the
true probability of one half is far higher than one half. It is in fact
closer to 0.7.

\subsection{Extended structural analysis}

Because Prelec's \citeyear{prelec_98} conditional invariant
model delivers the best overall fit, we now parameterize its main
components: $\sigma$, which captures the heteroskedasticity of the error
term; $\gamma$, which can be interpreted as the subjective probability
corresponding to objective certainty; and $\beta$, which corresponds to the
sensitivity of the subjective probability to low values of $p$ (i.e.,the
higher is $\beta$, the steeper is the slope of $p^{s}$ for low values of $p$, and the higher the value of $p$ at which the subjective and actual
probabilities cross). We perform this exercise based on the following
extended structural model, where the $\delta$'s can be interpreted either as
capturing the aggregate level of the associated deep structural parameter,
or simply as best-fit coefficients capturing the influence on deep
parameters of several variables at once: \footnote{We tried modelling all parameters of this model as functions of our data, but the
collinearity in the parameters is too great to allow for this, meaning there
is not enough variation in the data---rich as it is---to tease apart the
determinants of all of the parameters separately.}

\begin{eqnarray*}
p^{s} &=&\gamma \exp {[-}\frac{{\beta }}{\eta }{(1-{p}^{\eta })]+v} \\
\gamma &{=}&{x}_{it}\delta_{0} \\
{v} &{\sim }& N(0,\sigma^2) = N(0,{x}_{it}\delta_{1}) \\
\beta &{=}&{x}_{it}\delta_{2}
\end{eqnarray*}

%{\normalsize %\begin{eqnarray*}
%p^{s} &=&\gamma \exp {-\frac{{\beta }}{\eta }{(1-{p}^{\eta })}+v} \\
%\gamma  &{=}&{x}_{it}\delta _{0} \\
%{v} &{\sim }& N(0,\sigma)$=$N(0,{x}_{it}\delta _{1}) \\
%\beta  &{=}&{x}_{it}\delta _{2}
%\end{eqnarray*}
%}

%The standard deviation of the error term for each participant, $\sqrt{{x}_{it}\delta _{1}}$, is denoted as $\sigma$.
The results of estimating the parameters of this extended structural model using our data
are given in Table \ref{paramML}.
